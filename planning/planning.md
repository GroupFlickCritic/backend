# "flickcritic." (Planning Process)

## Preliminary
As a team, we decided to create an app that will utilize all the different programming languages we have learned. We also wanted to create something related to movies in hopes that we have many users, since everyone likes movies. Then we decided the apps purpose was to allow users to add their own reviews of movies, and then, in hopes to be humorous, have those reviews displayed in a style similar to those of an acclaimed critic. The user will also have the ability to edit and delete the reviews.

## Planning
(Wireframes and Scoffold Architecture- Day 1)
After deciding on "flickcritic.", we decided to first make wireframes to help organize and determine the app's parent tree. Initial work was split between frontend and backend. Backend created route controllers and schema models for the movies and reviews, and initiated MongoDB through a local host, while frontend scaffolded the different React components and their relationships.

(API Data and Deploy- Day 2)
Once the backend API was deployed to Heroku, each team member worked on an individual component's javascript, and contributed 2 movies with data as starting data for the API.

(Component Routing - Days 3-5)
After all components had their base structures completed, the team worked together on the functionality between routes.

(Styling, MDs, and Mock Presentation Day 6-7)
Once "flickcritic." was fully functional, both frontend and backend, half the team began styling, while the other half wrote the different MD files. To conclude preparation, the team conducted mock exhibitions to perfect our presentations

## Adaptations
For "flickcritic."'s planning rooms of improvement include: making a real timeline so that other resources can be considered if said timeline is not kept.
